# How to Locate and Delete Files Using Copilot and Terminal

This guide explains how to use GitHub Copilot (or similar AI assistants) to locate and delete files in your project, and how to complete the process in your terminal.

---

## 1. Locate the File with Copilot
- Ask Copilot to help you find the file you want to delete.
- Example prompt: `Show me where the file readme_presentation_av_said.md is located.`
- Copilot will provide the file path, e.g. `/Users/yourname/project/readme_presentation_av_said.md`.

## 2. Delete the File in Terminal
- Open your terminal.
- Navigate to your project directory:
  ```bash
  cd /Users/yourname/project
  ```
- Delete the file using:
  ```bash
  rm readme_presentation_av_said.md
  ```

## 3. (Optional) Remove from Git and Push Changes
If your project uses git:
- Stage the deletion:
  ```bash
  git add -A
  ```
- Commit the change:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Remove readme_presentation_av_said.md from repository"
  ```
- Push to GitHub:
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```

**Tip:**
- Try to smile. Your worst attempt trying might and up having you dead out laughing.
